# Mental Health Risk Prediction

This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess mental health risk using survey data. The dataset includes 101 entries with over 20 indicators related to behavioral, psychological, and demographic factors.

## Description

- Developed a Python-based machine learning pipeline to predict mental health risk.
- Engineered relevant features and handled missing or inconsistent data.
- Trained and evaluated three classifiers: Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Naive Bayes.
- Achieved 78% accuracy with the Naive Bayes classifier.
- Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results

The Naive Bayes classifier outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy and overall performance metrics, making it the most effective model for this dataset.
